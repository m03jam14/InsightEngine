## Key Insights

### Market Phase Analysis
The analysis reveals three distinct phases in Canadian mortgage rate evolution:

**Stable Period (2015-2019)**
- Consistent moderate rates averaging 2.5%
- Low volatility environment
- Predictable affordability patterns

**Emergency Response (2020-2021)**
- Historic lows reaching 1.85%
- Pandemic-driven monetary accommodation
- Temporary affordability improvement

**Normalization Cycle (2022-2024)**
- Aggressive tightening to 5%+ levels
- Highest volatility period in analyzed timeframe
- Significant affordability deterioration

### Statistical Findings
- Strong negative correlation between rates and affordability indices
- 2023 identified as peak volatility period with 30% fluctuation
- Clear cyclical patterns in rate adjustment mechanisms
